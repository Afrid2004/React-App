    title: 'HTML',
    body: 'HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the backbone of the web. Every website you see on the internet starts with HTML. It is responsible for creating the basic structure of a web page. Without HTML, there would be no headings, paragraphs, images, links, or forms.HTML works using elements and tags. These tags tell the browser what kind of content is being displayed. For example, headings define titles, paragraphs define text blocks, and images display visual content. HTML is not a programming language; it is a markup language used to organize and structure information.One of the biggest advantages of HTML is its simplicity. Beginners can start learning HTML very quickly, and it provides a strong entry point into web development. It also plays a crucial role in accessibility, allowing screen readers and assistive technologies to understand web content.Modern HTML, especially HTML5, supports multimedia elements like audio, video, and semantic tags. These features help developers build cleaner, more meaningful, and SEO-friendly websites.In short, HTML provides the skeleton of a website. It defines what content exists on a page and how it is arranged, making it an essential skill for anyone who wants to become a web developer.',

    title: 'CSS',
    body: 'CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the technology that brings life and beauty to a website. While HTML creates the structure, CSS controls the design and appearance. It defines colors, fonts, layouts, spacing, animations, and responsiveness. With CSS, developers can transform a simple HTML page into a visually appealing and professional-looking website. It allows full control over how elements appear on different screen sizes, making responsive design possible for mobile, tablet, and desktop users. One powerful feature of CSS is separation of concerns. Developers can keep content (HTML) and design (CSS) separate, which makes websites easier to maintain and update. A single CSS file can style multiple pages at once. Modern CSS includes advanced features such as Flexbox, Grid, transitions, and animations. These tools help developers create complex layouts and smooth user experiences without relying heavily on JavaScript. CSS is essential for branding and user experience. A well-designed website builds trust, improves usability, and keeps visitors engaged. Without CSS, the web would look plain and unattractive.',

    title: 'JavaScript',
    body: 'JavaScript is the programming language that makes websites dynamic and interactive. While HTML structures content and CSS styles it, JavaScript adds behavior and logic. It allows websites to respond to user actions like clicks, form submissions, and keyboard input.Using JavaScript, developers can create interactive features such as sliders, pop-ups, dropdown menus, and real-time form validation. It also enables dynamic content updates without reloading the page, improving user experience.JavaScript plays a major role in modern web applications. Technologies like React, Vue, and Angular are built on JavaScript, allowing developers to build fast and scalable single-page applications. It can also communicate with servers using APIs to fetch or send data.Another strength of JavaScript is its versatility. It runs in the browser as well as on the server using platforms like Node.js. This makes JavaScript a full-stack language.In summary, JavaScript turns static websites into interactive applications. It is a must-have skill for any frontend developer who wants to build modern, user-friendly web experiences.',
